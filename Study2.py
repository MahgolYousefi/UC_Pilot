**Background on Good Irrigation Practices for Dairy Farms**

The DairyNZ Guide to Good Irrigation is designed to assist dairy farmers in refining their irrigation practices. It is essential for farm staff and managers to understand how factors such as soil and plant types, climate, and the capabilities of various irrigation systems impact the farmâ€™s irrigation needs. The guide emphasizes the importance of timely and appropriate water application, considering both volume and frequency, to optimize farm operations. Key aspects include managing water supply conditions, ensuring water quality, using water efficiently, and maintaining irrigation equipment effectively.

Additionally, it stresses the importance of soil moisture monitoring, upgrading old systems, and the strategic planning necessary when designing and installing new irrigation systems. This comprehensive approach aims to foster better irrigation practices that not only meet the specific needs of the farm but also contribute to responsible water management within the broader community.
